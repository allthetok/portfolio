My journey in software development has led me through various projects, each one teaching me new skills and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. In my 5 years in the industry, I've honed my skills in [mention specific technologies or areas you specialize in, e.g., full-stack development, front-end frameworks like Angular, back-end with Node.js, etc.]. I've had the pleasure of working on diverse projects, from developing scalable web applications to optimizing database performance. Each project has been a learning experience, refining my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail."
		details: "Back in 2018, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led design studio, and a huge corporation."

	{
		heading: 'My Experience 2',
		details: "My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Upstatement. I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released an online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API."

The energy and creativity of EDM artists never fail to inspire me, and it's a passion I share with many fellow enthusiasts. Gaming is another realm where I find joy and relaxation. Whether it's diving into the latest AAA titles or indulging in retro classics, gaming has been a part of my life since childhood. It's not just about entertainment; gaming also fuels my creativity and strategic thinking.	On the hardware side of things, I have a keen interest in PC hardware. Building and tweaking PCs to get the best performance is not just a hobby but a fascination. From selecting the right components to optimizing for efficiency, I enjoy every aspect of the hardware-software synergy."
